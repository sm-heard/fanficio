### Frequent Reader
 As a frequent reader, I want a nice, clean interface to read on.  I want to be
 able to read my stories offline. I wanna sort on favorites and alerts and
 updated stories.

 ### Reader That Takes Breaks
 I want to be able to pick off from the last place I was reading in the chapter. I want to
 know which chapters and stories I've already read so I can pick up from where
 I left off.
